# Carp in a Pond

A simple, interactive web application that simulates a serene pond environment with animated carp. Experience the calming movement of fish and interact with the water by creating ripples.

## Features

*   **Animated Carp:** Multiple colorful carp swim gracefully across the pond.
*   **Interactive Ripples:** Click anywhere on the pond to create a realistic ripple effect.
*   **Responsive Fish Behavior:** Carp react to your clicks, darting away from the disturbance.
*   **Visually Engaging:** A relaxing and aesthetically pleasing simulation.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the pond, carp, and ripple effects, including animations.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For handling carp movement, interactions, and dynamic elements.
